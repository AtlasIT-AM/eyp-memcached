# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as
# part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more
# information.

logfile <%= @logfile %>

<% case @verbose_level -%>
<% when "0" -%>
# no verbose
<% when "1" -%>
# Be verbose
-v
<% else -%>
# Be even more verbose (print client commands as well)

# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory

# Run the daemon as root. The start-memcached will default to running as root if no
# -u command is present in this config file
-u <%= @user %>

# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses
# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure
# it's listening on a firewalled interface.
